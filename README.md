- Hi, I’m @FadulSikder. I am a first-generation international student pursuing my Ph.D. in the United States.
- Currently, my research interests are situated in the sphere of Blockchain, Smart Contract, and the security and trustability implications of those technologies. I am researching to apply traditional software analysis techniques like symbolic execution and fuzzing to create new tools and approaches for testing Smart Contracts on different Blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Cardona, Solana, etc. 
- I’m currently learning Web3 Development and Spring Boot. I am proficient in C++, Object Oriented Programming. Additionally, I have expertise in Machine Learning, Semantic Analysis.
- I’m looking to collaborate on the research area mentioned earlier. Additionally, my long-term goal is to get expertise in Systems Design, which will enable me to develop complex systems. I am also open to collaboration in this area if possible.
- Ping me in my LinkedIN if needed.
